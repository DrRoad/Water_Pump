# Water_Pump
Analysis of SCADA data belonging to a Water Pump compared to the pump curve from the vendor.  The initial exercise was to develop a model in R then compare the vendor literature versus the measures performance.

The project could do with a few additions such as reading in all of the pump data and developing a parameterisation for each configuration and some nicer web based graphics such as per Plotly 3D examples .  Presently it uses RGL package.
